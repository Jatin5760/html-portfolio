    <p style="color: darkorange; text-align: right;">I'm Jatin Sharma, a software engineer with over 10 years of experience in the industry. I'm passionate about building innovative and user-friendly software. I'm also a strong advocate for open source software and have contributed to several open source projects.

      I founded [Your Company Name] because I wanted to create a company that could help businesses succeed by providing them with the software solutions they need to grow and thrive. I'm committed to providing my clients with the highest quality of service and the most innovative solutions.
      
      I believe that software should be made accessible to everyone, regardless of their budget or technical expertise. That's why I'm committed to providing my clients with affordable, easy-to-use software that can help them achieve their goals.
  
      I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I'm also a strong believer in giving back to the community. That's why I volunteer my time to teach software development classes to underprivileged youth.
  
      If you're looking for a software engineer who can help you build the software solution you need to grow your business, then I'm the right person for you. I'm passionate, experienced, and committed to providing my clients with the best possible service.
